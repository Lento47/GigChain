# ‚úÖ Phase 3: Scale - Implementation Checklist (REVISED)

Quick reference checklist for implementing Phase 3 with **GigSoul (GSL) internal token system**.

> **üîÑ REVISION**: GigSoul (GSL) tokens are now internal (database-backed), not blockchain ERC20. This simplifies development significantly.

**Progress Tracking**: Use `[x]` for completed items, `[ ]` for pending.
